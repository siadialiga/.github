**Siadialiga** is an independent software development space where individual projects are built, tested, and refined.  
It focuses on creating clean, modern, and sustainable software using up-to-date technologies.

## What I Work On
- Web applications
- Open-source projects  
- Experimental and learning-driven software  
- Performance, design, and user experience–focused development  

## Philosophy
- Clean and readable code  
- Modern tech stack  
- Continuous learning and improvement  
- Simple solutions over unnecessary complexity  

## Purpose
To turn personal ideas into real projects,  
contribute to the open-source ecosystem,  
and build a solid foundation for future, larger-scale ideas.

## Notes
Siadialiga is an **individual initiative**, not a registered company.  
All projects are developed and maintained independently.
